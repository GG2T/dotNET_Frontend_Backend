Unzip it to a local folder. Start PowerShell (if you are on Windows) or Terminal (of you are on MacOS) and change directory (cd) to this local folder where the server is unzipped into. Issue the command dotnet A3.dll. You can test if the server is functional by trying the favicon link http://localhost:5000/logo-192x192.pngLinks to an external site., the version endpoint http://localhost:5000/api/GetVersionLinks to an external site., and the staff list endpoint http://localhost:5000/api/GetAllStaffLinks to an external site.. You can also monitor your command window (i.e., PowerShell or Terminal) to see if there are any server errors.
